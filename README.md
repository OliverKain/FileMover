Author: My Quoc Hoang

Instruction:

First, you have to download the project's source code and make an excutable .jar file.

Next, you can make a context menu for executing the .jar file.
  1. Type "shell:sendto" in windows explorer's address bar (without quote).
  2. Move the TorrentMove.bat into Sendto Folder.

Now, you can move a file using that context menu.

Happy Using! :)
